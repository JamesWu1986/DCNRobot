Tunnel Capacity test
====================

This test determines how many frames the DUT loses with various numbers of tunnels. This test uses pairs of ports with one-to-one traffic mapping; one port transmits to one receive port. You specify the number of frames to transmit, the transmit rate, and the number of tunnels to test with for each trial.

The test begins by checking link states on ports to ensure that all the links are up. The transmit and receive ports then ARP to learn the IP address of their corresponding DUT ports. Each receive port then establishes a tunnel with its corresponding DUT port. 

Starting with the initial tunnel load (the number of tunnels configured for the test), the test transmits the specified number of frames, counts the number received (the number the DUT is able to forward). If the DUT is unable to forward all the frames, the test decreases the number of tunnels and transmits again. 

This process continues until the test finds a tunnel capacity at which the DUT can forward all the frames it receives. The results of the test display the frame loss for various tunnel loads for each frame size.
