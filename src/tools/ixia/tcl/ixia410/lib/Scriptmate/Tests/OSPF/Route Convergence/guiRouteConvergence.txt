OSPF Route Convergence test
===========================

The route convergence test tests the ability of a DUT router to switch between preferred and less-preferred routes when the preferred routes are withdrawn and re-advertised.

In this test, two Ixia receive (Rx) ports simulate OSPF routers, Router 1 and Router 2. Both routers advertise the same route prefixes to the simulated network. However, the routes advertised by Router 1 have smaller metrics (lower costs), which should cause the DUT to forward traffic over them instead of Router 2’s routes.

After advertising the routes, the transmit port begins transmitting a stream of packets to an address in each of the advertised route prefixes. The DUT should forward all the packets over the route with the lower metric (Router 1).

After a time interval has elapsed, the receive port simulating Router 1 withdraws its routes. The DUT should detect that the preferred route has gone down and switch traffic to Router 2’s routes. Router 1 then re-advertises its routes. The DUT should again detect a change re-route traffic to the receive port simulating Router 1.

The test continues until the Duration parameter elapses. If you specified more than one trial, the test waits for the DUT’s OSPF Dead Interval to expire, causing the DUT to purge its route table. Then, the test starts the next trial using the same frame size. After the trials for that frame size are complete, the test either ends or, if you specified more than one frame size, waits for the DUT’s OSPF Dead Interval to expire, then restarts with the next larger frame size.
