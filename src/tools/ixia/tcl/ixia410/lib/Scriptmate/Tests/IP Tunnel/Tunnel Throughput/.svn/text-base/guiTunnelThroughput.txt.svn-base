Tunnel Throughput test
======================

This test determines the maximum rate at which the DUT can receive and forward frames without any frame loss. Frames are initially sent at a user-specified rate, generally the maximum theoretical rate based on the speed of the port. 

If the DUT fails to forward all the frames, the test re-transmits at successively lower rates until the DUT forwards all the frames. It then searches for a rate between the last two successful rates until it finds the highest rate at which the DUT forwards all the frames.
 
The setting for the Binary Search parameter determines how the test searches for a new rate. 

- If you set this field to Per-Port, the binary search algorithm treats each receive port separately. If the test must change the transmit rate, it changes it only for specific ports.

-If you set this field to Linear, the binary search algorithm treats all receive ports as a group. If the test must change the transmit rate, it changes it for all ports.

The test begins by checking link states on ports to ensure that all the links are up. The transmit and receive ports then ARP to learn the IP address of their corresponding DUT ports. Each receive port then establishes a tunnel with its corresponding DUT port. 

This test is configured with a one-to-one traffic mapping. The results of the test show the throughput rates in frames per second obtained for each frame size. The results also show the average throughput rates for all the trials.
