IS-IS Performance test
======================

The ISIS Performance test will setup user defined routes and topology, then measure no-drop throughput and latency between advertised port. This test will characterize the performance of the DUT by emulating the pre-defined numbers of ISIS routing sessions and routes. The data plane test will then follow to determine the throughput and latency. The test can be repeated manually to vary the size of emulated topology. The combined performance of control plane and data plane can then be evaluated.

Definitions: 

·Throughput refers to the number amount of frames being sent that are actually being received.  

·Latency refers to the time needed by a frame to run from the Ixia Transmit Port to the Ixia Receive Port.
