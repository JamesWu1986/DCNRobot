OSPF Convergence test
=====================

This test tests the ability of an OSPF router to switch between preferred and less-preferred routes when the preferred routes are withdrawn and re-advertised. This test differs from the OSPF Route Convergence Test in the following ways:

- It supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addressing
- It supports OSPF version 2 and version 3
- It allows you to specify which Link State Advertisements (LSAs) are advertised and withdrawn
- It does not use packet loss to determine convergence time (though it does report the number of packets lost)

In this test, two Ixia receive (Rx) ports simulate OSPF routers. Both routers advertise the same route prefixes to the simulated network. However, the routes advertised by the first transmit/receive port pair have smaller metrics (lower costs), which should cause the DUT to forward traffic over them instead of the routes advertised by the second port.
