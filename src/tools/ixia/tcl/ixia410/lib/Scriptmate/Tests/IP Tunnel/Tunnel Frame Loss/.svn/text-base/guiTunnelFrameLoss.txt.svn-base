Tunnel Frame Loss test
======================

This test determines how many frames the DUT loses at various frame rates. This test uses IPv6 tunnels with pairs of ports with one-to-one traffic mapping; one port transmits to one receive port. You specify the number of frames to transmit, the initial transmit rate, and the percentage decrease in the frame rate (the Granularity parameter) for each iteration.

The test begins by checking link states on ports to ensure that all the links are up. The transmit and receive ports then ARP to learn the IP address of their corresponding DUT ports. Each receive port then establishes a tunnel with its corresponding DUT port. 

Starting with the initial frame rate, the test transmits the specified number of frames, counts the number received (the number the DUT is able to forward). If the DUT is unable to forward all the frames, the test decreases the frame rate and transmits again. 

This test continues until it finds a rate at which the DUT can forward all the frames it receives. The results of the test display the frame loss for various rates for each frame size.
